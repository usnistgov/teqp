    "When it comes to mixture thermodynamics, as soon as you add another component to a pure component to form a binary mixture, the complexity of the thermodynamics entirely changes. For that reason, mixture iterative calculations for mixtures are orders of magnitude more difficult to carry out.  Asymmetric mixtures can do all sorts of interesting things that are entirely unlike those of pure fluids, and the algorithms are therefore much, much more complicated. Formulating phase equilibrium problems is not much more complicated than for pure fluids, but the most challenging aspect is to obtain good guess values from which to start an iterative routine, and the difficulty of this problem increases with the complexity of the mixture thermodynamics.\n",

    "Ulrich Deiters and Ian Bell have developed a number of algorithms for tracing phase equilibrium solutions as the solution of ordinary differential equations rather than carrying out iterative routines for a given state point.  The advantage of the tracing calculations is that they can often be initiated at a state point that is entirely known, for instance the pure fluid endpoint for a subcritical isotherm or isobar."
